## Find the Cynics IP Camera URL
 
The first step to connect to your Cynics camera is to find its IP address and port number. You can do this by using a network scanner tool, such as Angry IP Scanner or Advanced IP Scanner, to scan your local network and find the devices connected to it. Alternatively, you can check the label on your camera or DVR for the default IP address and port number.
 
Once you have the IP address and port number of your Cynics camera, you need to find the correct URL format for it. The URL format depends on the model and protocol of your camera. You can try the following connection options in iSpy or Agent DVR to connect to your Cynics camera:
 
- FFMPEG: rtsp://IPADDRESS/profile1
- ONVIF: http://IPADDRESS/onvif/device\_service

If these options do not work, you can check this page for more Cynics camera URLs: [https://www.ispyconnect.com/camera/cynics](https://www.ispyconnect.com/camera/cynics)
