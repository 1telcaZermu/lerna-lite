The tool will then copy and extract the scenery files to your P3D v4 folder. This might take a few minutes depending on your system speed. You will see some messages on the command prompt window indicating the progress of the installation. When it is done, you will see a message saying "Installation complete!" and you can close the window.
 
## Step 4: Run the Scenery Configurator
 
The final step is to run the Scenery Configurator by double-clicking on the file named "FSDG-Scenery Configurator.exe" inside the "Scenery Configurator" folder. This will launch a graphical user interface that will allow you to customize some settings for FSDG Seychelles scenery, such as mesh resolution, water effects, AI traffic density, etc. You can also enable or disable some features, such as static aircraft, dynamic lighting, etc.
 
You can experiment with different settings to suit your preferences and system performance. Once you are happy with your settings, click on "Save & Close" to apply them. You can run the Scenery Configurator again anytime if you want to change something later.
