## About Lerna-Lite
Lerna-Lite differs from the original [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) in the sense that it only has a limited set of commands from Lerna which itself has 15 commands while Lerna-Lite only includes 6 of them (and 2 of them are even optional). Lerna was originally built as an all-in-one tool, however nowadays Workspaces are available in all dependency managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) and the need for that all-in-one tool including built-in workspaces functionality is no longer needed. Lerna-Lite is built around that new fact and its CLI only includes the `publish` and `version` commands, while there are other commands available (like `exec` and `run`) they are totally optional and you won't download them unless you opt-in. So in summary it is more modular than the original Lerna and it may seem like a small change but it does make it more versatile (with smaller downloads and less dependencies) to use with other tools like Turborepo, pnpm and others...

 As a summary, Lerna-Lite assumes, and requires, to pre-setup a Workspace through your favorite package manager (NPM, pnpm, Yarn) that will take care of the symlinks (Lerna-Lite does **not include** the `bootstrap`, neither `link` commands hence the need for a workspace pre-setup), so make sure that your workspace is properly setup before installing Lerna-Lite.

 Info on how to setup a workspace, can be found at these links: [Yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) / [Yarn 2+](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) / [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) / [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces),

## Why create this lib/fork?
Mainly for the following reasons:
1. the original Lerna was no longer maintained (dependencies were out of date)
2. create a smaller lib that is more modular than the original Lerna
  - the lib is smaller since we only copied 6 out of 15 commands from Lerna (some are optional). We don't need all packages of Lerna anymore since NPM Workspaces (or other technologies) came out.
  - the main goal of this fork is to keep `version` and `publish` commands and make anything else as optional packages
3. rewritten the lib in TypeScript
4. replicate a few opened PR from Lerna and also add new feature
  - like the new support for `workspace:` protocol and `dry-run` options

### This lib will help you with
#### [Version](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version) and [Publish](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/publish) commands
- Automate the rolling of new Versions (`independent` or `fixed`) of all your workspace packages.
  - it will automatically Commit & Tag your new Version in Git & create new GitHub/GitLab Release (when enabled).
- Automate the creation of Changelogs for all your packages by reading all [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
  - each package will get its own changelog and a merged changelog will also be created in the root.
- Automate the repository Publish of your new versions for all your packages (NPM or other platform).

#### [Exec](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/exec) and [Run](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/run) commands (optional)
- [Exec](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/exec#readme) is an optional package that will help you execute shell commands in parallel and in topological order.
- [Run](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/run#readme) is an optional package that will help you run npm script in parallel and in topological order.

### Project Demo?
You want to see a project demo? Sure, you're looking at it üòâ

Yes indeed, this lib was created specifically as an NPM Workspace for the sole purpose of demoing and testing its own code. All changelogs and published versions were created and pushed by the lib itself, how sweet is that? You will also find that it has its own [lerna.json](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/blob/main/lerna.json) config file to run properly.

### See it in Action üé¶
You can see a small video of a new version release on this [Release Demo - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/wiki/Release-Demo) to demonstrate its usage. Are you confused with all the options? These following links might help you get started.

## Installation
Run the following commands to install Lerna-Lite in your project and/or install it globally by adding the `-g` option.

| Command | Install         | Description | Included |
|---------|-------------|-------------| ---------|
| üèÅ [init](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/init#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/cli -D -W` | create/initialize a new Lerna-Lite repo | Yes |
| üíª [info](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/info#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/cli -D -W` | print local environment information | Yes |
| üìë [version](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/version#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/cli -D -W` | create new version for each workspace package | Yes |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è [publish](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/publish#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/cli -D -W` | publish each workspace package | Yes |
| üë∑ [exec](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/exec#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/exec -D -W` | execute an command in each workspace package | Optional |
| üèÉ [run](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/tree/main/packages/run#readme) | `npm i @lerna-lite/run -D -W` | run npm script in each workspace package | Optional |

**Note:** the default `lerna` CLI is only including 3 built-in commands (`info`,`publish`,`version`), while the (`exec`,`run`) commands are optional and must be installed separately as shown below.

```bash
# Lerna CLI which includes `info`, `init`, `publish` and `version` commands
npm install @lerna-lite/cli -D -W   # OR yard add @lerna-lite/cli -D -W

# optionally install `exec` and/or `run` commands
npm install @lerna-lite/exec -D -W  # OR yarn add @lerna-lite/exec -D -W
npm install @lerna-lite/run -D -W   # OR yarn add @lerna-lite/run -D -W
```

### Usage
Add custom NPM Scripts or simply run the commands in a shell with Lerna-Lite CLI.
```js
// package.json / npm scripts
"scripts": {
  "new-version": "lerna version",
  "new-publish": "lerna publish from-package",

  "exec-echo": "lerna exec echo hello", // optional `exec` command
  "run-tests": "lerna run test",        // optional `run` command
}
```

### Configuration
You could configure and run Lerna in 3 different ways:
1. via a `lerna.json` file
2. or by passing arguments directly directly in the shell when executing the command.

You can find more info by reading about the [`lerna.json` - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/wiki/lerna.json).

### Migration for [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) Users
If you are migrating from Lerna, it should be fairly easy to just replace Lerna with Lerna-Lite in your dependencies and that's about it, the CLI commands are the same, take a look at the quick steps shown below:
1. remove Lerna from your local & global dependencies
```sh
npm uninstall lerna -W   # OR yarn remove lerna -W
npm uninstall -g lerna   # OR yarn global remove lerna
```
2. install Lerna-Lite CLI to get access to `info`, `version` and `publish` commands
   - `exec` and `run` commands are **optional** and can be installed separately as shown below
```sh
# Lerna CLI (includes `info`, `version` and `publish` commands)
npm install @lerna-lite/cli -D -W
```
3. optionally install `exec` and/or `run` commands
```sh
# optionally install `exec` command
npm install @lerna-lite/exec -D -W

# optionally install `run` command
npm install @lerna-lite/run -D -W
```

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute any Pull Request, PRs are very welcome. üë∑üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also please note that I'm just a simple developer & user of this lib, the same as you are, my knowledge of the library is also probably similar to yours but together we can make it better (and lighter).

### Development / Contributions
If you wish to contribute to the project, please follow these steps
1. clone the lib:
   - `git clone https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite`
2. install with **NPM 8+**:
   - `npm install`
3. run a TypeScript (TSC) build
   - `npm run build`
4. add/run Jest unit tests (make sure to run the previous steps first):
   - `npm run jest  # OR npm run jest:watch`
5. you can troubleshoot/debug the code via the VSCode debugger launch configs that were setup

## Troubleshooting
If you have problems running the lib and your problems are related to Git commands that were executed, then we suggest to first try with the `--git-dry-run` (or `--cmd-dry-run`) option to see if it helps in finding the error(s) you may have. Another great, and possibly much more useful suggestion, is to search in the original Lerna [issues](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues) list and see if any solution could help you (remember that Lerna-Lite is a fork of the original code from Lerna and it works the same way). Lastly, if that is not enough and you wish to troubleshoot yourself, then read this [Troubleshooting - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/lerna-lite/wiki/Troubleshooting) to possibly troubleshoot yourself in your own environment.
